# Contributing to UAV-Architect-Global

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **UAV-Architect-Global** project! We welcome contributions from developers, researchers, and UAV enthusiasts who want to enhance the future of autonomous flight systems.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Bugs
- Use the GitHub Issue Tracker to report bugs.
- Provide a clear description of the issue and steps to reproduce.

### 2. Suggesting Enhancements
- If you have ideas for new features or architectural improvements, open an issue to discuss them.

### 3. Pull Requests
- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch for your feature or fix.
- Ensure your code follows the project's architectural principles.
- Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.

## Architectural Principles
- **Efficiency:** Algorithms must be optimized for real-time execution on embedded systems.
- **Modularity:** Keep system components (CV, PID, GCS) decoupled.
- **Safety:** Always prioritize failsafe mechanisms (RTL, Geo-fencing).

## Professional Conduct
- Be respectful and collaborative in all interactions.
